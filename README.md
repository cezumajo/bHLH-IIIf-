# bHLH genes belongin to the IIIf
This repository contains alignments and sequences used for the analyses presented in the paper "Evolutionary studies of the bHLH transcription factors belonging to MBW: revisiting their role in seed development."  
The file bHLHforPhylogeny.phy is the alignment used for performing the ML analysis. 
The file bHLHunaliged.translated.fasta are selected the protein sequences used for the MEME analyses.
The file Promoters_coordinates.xlsx contains all the information about the regulatory regions included in the analyses (upstream the Starting Transcription site).
