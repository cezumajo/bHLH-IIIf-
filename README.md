This repository contains alignments and sequences used for the analyses presented in the paper "Evolutionary studies of the bHLH transcription factors belonging to MBW: their role in seed development."  
The file bHLHforPhylogeny.phy is the alignment used for performing the ML analysis. 
In the file bHLHunaliged.translated.fasta you will find the selected protein sequences used for the MEME analyses.
The file Promoters_coordinates.xlsx contains all the information about the regulatory regions included in the analyses (upstream of the Starting Transcription site).
